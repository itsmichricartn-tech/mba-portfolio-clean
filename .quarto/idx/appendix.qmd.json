Global Structure Prompt\nYou are a UX-savvy writing assistant helping me build a clean, professional multi-page MBA portfolio with Quarto.\nDeliverables:\n\n  • A site map with 6–7 pages: Home, Resume, Projects, Skills & Certifications, Contact, Reflection, Appendix.\n\n  • A Quarto navbar outline (file names like index.qmd, resume.qmd, etc.).\n\n  • One 10–15 word description per page.Style: concise, practical, business-ready; avoid hype. Output in Markdown only.\n\n### B2. Home/About Tone Prompt\nYou are a friendly, UX-savvy writing assistant. Rewrite a short Home/About intro (3–5 sentences).\n\n• Goals: approachable, competent, people-centric HR + current culinary practice in Vancouver.\nMust include: name, MBA Candidate at University Canada West (Vancouver, BC); strengths in Compensation & Benefits, employee services, onboarding; values of clarity, service, and reliable processes; CTAs: “View Resume”, “View Projects”, “Download PDF”.\nOutput: ≤2 short paragraphs, no emojis, no hype.\n\n\n### B3. Resume Tightening Prompt\n\nTighten resume bullets for these roles (keep employer/location/dates as given):\n\n• Compensation & Benefits Analyst — Shell Licensee (Santo Domingo, DR) (Dec 2021–Sep 2024)\n\n• General Analyst — Shell Licensee (Dec 2021–Aug 2024)\n\n• Cook — Guilt and Co (Vancouver, Oct 2025–Present)\n\n• Line Cook — Six Acres (Mar–May 2025)\n\n• Plater — Fed (Mar–Sep 2025)\n\n• Stock Service — ZARA (Nov 2019–Nov 2021)\n\n• Rules: 2–3 bullets per role; action-first verbs; clear outcome/impact where possible; ≤140 characters per bullet; no fluff.\n\n• Output only Markdown lists under each role title.\n\n### B4. Projects Formatting Prompt\n\nTurn each project into a compact card with three fields:\n\n• Overview (1–2 sentences)\n\n• Role (my contribution)\n\n• Outcome (practical result)\n\nReturn plain HTML with three div class=\"card\" blocks that drop into a Quarto page.\n\n### B5. Skills/Badges Prompt\n\n• Return a single Markdown block with inline “badges” for core HR and professional skills.  \n\n• Format each badge as: `<span class=\"badge\">Skill Name</span>` separated by spaces/newlines. \n\n• Include: Compensation & Benefits, Employee Services, Onboarding, Internal Communications, Excel (dashboards), Time Management, Problem-Solving, Teamwork, Customer Service, Spanish & English.\n\n• Do not add explanations—badges only.\n\n### B6. Reflection Prompt\n\n• Write a 300–500 word reflection about building a multi-page MBA portfolio with Quarto and LLMs.  \n\n• Cover: (1) what improved when adding pages, (2) how you verified authenticity/accuracy, (3) limits/risks of LLMs and how you mitigated them (citations, manual review, dated notes, style control), (4) what you’d iterate next (accessibility, performance, content depth).  \n\n• Tone: honest, specific, first person. Output in Markdown (no title).\n\n---\n\n## C) Selected LLM Output (Snippets)\n\n### C1. Global Structure (excerpt)\n• **Home:** concise positioning + 3 CTAs.  \n• **Resume:** education, roles, selected skills.  \n• **Projects:** 3 cards with overview / role / outcome.  \n• **Skills:** badges + tools.  \n• **Contact:** email, LinkedIn, location, PDF link.  \n• **Reflection:** 300–500 words on LLM use + authenticity.  \n• **Appendix:** prompts & outputs, clearly labeled.\n\n### C2. Home/About Intro (used with light edits)\n\nI have a degree in people-oriented industrial psychology, with experience in <strong>Human Resources</strong>, mainly in the <strong>Compensation and Benefits</strong> department, recruitment, and onboarding processes. I am currently developing my culinary skills in Vancouver, British Columbia.  I define myself by always <strong>prioritizing</strong> customer service, prioritizing clarity and reliability in processes, thereby positively transforming the decisions that can be made to have a positive impact on the future of companies and their operations. \n\n\n### C3. Resume Bullet Tightening (example applied)\n**Compensation & Benefits Analyst — Shell Licensee (Dec 2021–Sep 2024)**\n\n• Resolved employee inquiries on benefits/payroll/policies, improving response consistency and perceived service quality.  \n\n• Coordinated labour-ministry documentation, reducing certification turnaround time and rework.  \n\n• Prepared letters, contracts, and official communications with version control and correct formatting.\n\n\n### C5. Skills/Badges line (used)\n\n<div class=\"badges\">\n  <span class=\"badge\">Compensation & Benefits</span>\n  <span class=\"badge\">Employee Services</span>\n  <span class=\"badge\">Onboarding</span>\n  <span class=\"badge\">Internal Communications</span>\n  <span class=\"badge\">Excel (dashboards)</span>\n  <span class=\"badge\">Time Management</span>\n  <span class=\"badge\">Problem-Solving</span>\n  <span class=\"badge\">Teamwork</span>\n  <span class=\"badge\">Customer Service</span>\n  <span class=\"badge\">Spanish & English</span>\n</div>\n\n\n## D) AI Use & APA Citations\n\n### D1. Generative-AI Use Statement\n\nI used ChatGPT (**GPT-5 Thinking**) to support this assignment in bounded, transparent ways:\n\n• **Brainstorming & structure:** initial site map and page outlines; I reviewed, reordered, and finalized navigation.\n\n• **Copy help:** tone tightening and readability edits for *Home*, *Projects*, and *Skills*; I verified accuracy and rewrote where needed.\n\n• **Code snippets:** Quarto/Markdown scaffolds and small CSS utilities (badges, soft-hero gradient). I tested and adjusted locally.\n\n• **Documentation hygiene:** selected prompts and outputs are included in **Appendix B–C**; diffs and rationales are noted inline.\n\n• **Limits & authenticity.** All facts (education, work history, skills) reflect my real background. I verified every claim, removed hallucinations, and kept authorship control. The website is built locally with Quarto and published via GitHub Pages. I am accountable for the final content.\n\n• **Data & privacy.** No private or sensitive data was shared in prompts. No proprietary data was uploaded.\n\n• **Reproducibility.** **Model & session:** ChatGPT (*GPT-5 Thinking*), Nov 2025. Prompts are archived locally and representative excerpts are shown in **Appendix B**; selected model outputs are in **Appendix C**.\n\n---\n\n### D2. APA-Style References (samples)\n\n• OpenAI.

Major edits across drafts**\n\n• **Home:** Replaced long intro with a concise value statement; added clear CTAs (View Resume, Projects, Download PDF).\n\n• **Resume:** Tightened bullets to action-first outcomes; limited to 2–3 bullets/role; removed filler.\n\n• **Projects:** Standardized 3-card layout (Overview · Role · Outcome) for quick scanning.\n\n• **Skills & Certifications:** Switched to compact “badges” for readability on mobile.\n\n• **Contact:** Simplified to essentials (location, email, LinkedIn, resume link).\n\n• **Theme/UX:** Added soft gradient background, improved spacing, and consistent heading scale.\n\n**E2. Why these changes? (Rationales)**\n\n• **Clarity & scannability:** Recruiters skim; compact sections and consistent patterns reduce \ncognitive load.\n\n• **Outcome focus:** Bullets emphasize impact, not tasks—clearer value for HR roles.\n\n• **Accessibility:** Larger line-height, badge contrast, and predictable navigation improve readability.\n\n• **Authenticity:** All facts (work history, skills) were verified and kept in my own voice.\n\n**E3. What I did NOT include (and why)**\n\n• **Leadership/Community/Publication pages:** Deferred to future iterations to keep scope manageable and maintain quality.\n\n• **Long-form narrative:** Avoided long paragraphs in Resume/Projects to favor scannable content.\n\n**E4. Risks & mitigations**\n\n• **Risk:** Visual polish might distract from content.  \n  **Mitigation:** Kept color accents subtle, prioritized typography and spacing.\n\n• **Risk:** Overfitting to one audience.  \n  **Mitigation:** Kept language professional-general; industry specifics live inside project cards.\n\n**E5. Evidence of authorship**\n\n• All data points (dates, roles, responsibilities) map to my CV and personal records.\n\n• Prompts and selected outputs are archived in this Appendix (Sections B–C).\n\n• Local build logs and commit history show progressive edits (see Git history timeline).\n\n---","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## A) Site Map (LLM Brainstorm → Final)\n\n**Context:** Drafted with ChatGPT (GPT-5 Thinking) on 2025-11-22.
