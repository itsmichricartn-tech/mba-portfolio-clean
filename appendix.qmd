## A) Site Map (LLM Brainstorm → Final)

**Context:** Drafted with ChatGPT (GPT-5 Thinking) on 2025-11-22. Purpose: plan a multi-page MBA portfolio for Assignment 3.

**LLM Brainstorm (verbatim):**
1) Home/About — short positioning and CTAs.  
2) Resume — education, roles, selected skills.  
3) Projects/Case Studies — 3–5 cards with overview/role/outcome.  
4) Skills & Certifications — badges + small list of tools.  
5) Contact — location, email, LinkedIn, resume download.  
6) Optional: Reflection on learning and authentic use of LLMs.  
7) Optional: Appendix with prompts and outputs for transparency.

**Final site structure (published):**
- [Home](index.qmd)  
- [Resume](resume.qmd)  
- [Projects / Case Studies](projects.qmd)  
- [Skills & Certifications](skills.qmd)  
- [Contact](contact.qmd)  
- [Reflection](reflection.qmd)  
- [Appendix](appendix.qmd)

**Notes (Kept / Edited / Removed):**
- **Kept:** Core five pages (Home, Resume, Projects, Skills, Contact).  
- **Edited:** Added **Reflection** and **Appendix** to meet assignment requirements and improve transparency.  
- **Removed / Deferred:** Leadership / Community / Publications (planned for a future iteration).

### B1. Global Structure Prompt
You are a UX-savvy writing assistant helping me build a clean, professional multi-page MBA portfolio with Quarto.

## D) AI Use & APA Citations

### D1. Generative-AI Use Statement
I used ChatGPT (**GPT-5 Thinking**) to support this assignment in bounded, transparent ways:

- **Brainstorming & structure:** initial site map and page outlines; I reviewed, reordered, and finalized navigation.
- **Copy help:** tone tightening and readability edits for *Home*, *Projects*, and *Skills*; I verified accuracy and rewrote where needed.
- **Code snippets:** Quarto/Markdown scaffolds and small CSS utilities (badges, soft-hero gradient). I tested and adjusted locally.
- **Documentation hygiene:** selected prompts and outputs are included in **Appendix B–C**; diffs and rationales are noted inline.

**Limits & authenticity.** All facts (education, work history, skills) reflect my real background. I verified every claim, removed hallucinations, and kept authorship control. The website is built locally with Quarto and published via GitHub Pages. I am accountable for the final content.

**Data & privacy.** No private or sensitive data was shared in prompts. No proprietary data was uploaded.

**Reproducibility.** **Model & session:** ChatGPT (*GPT-5 Thinking*), Nov 2025. Prompts are archived locally and representative excerpts are shown in **Appendix B**; selected model outputs are in **Appendix C**.

## E) Change Log & Rationale

**E1. Major edits across drafts**
- **Home:** Replaced long intro with a concise value statement; added clear CTAs (View Resume, Projects, Download PDF).
- **Resume:** Tightened bullets to action-first outcomes; limited to 2–3 bullets/role; removed filler.
- **Projects:** Standardized 3-card layout (Overview · Role · Outcome) for quick scanning.
- **Skills & Certifications:** Switched to compact “badges” for readability on mobile.
- **Contact:** Simplified to essentials (location, email, LinkedIn, resume link).
- **Theme/UX:** Added soft gradient background, improved spacing, and consistent heading scale.

**E2. Why these changes? (Rationales)**
- **Clarity & scannability:** Recruiters skim; compact sections and consistent patterns reduce cognitive load.
- **Outcome focus:** Bullets emphasize impact, not tasks—clearer value for HR roles.
- **Accessibility:** Larger line-height, badge contrast, and predictable navigation improve readability.
- **Authenticity:** All facts (work history, skills) were verified and kept in my own voice.

**E3. What I did NOT include (and why)**
- **Leadership/Community/Publication pages:** Deferred to future iterations to keep scope manageable and maintain quality.
- **Long-form narrative:** Avoided long paragraphs in Resume/Projects to favor scannable content.

**E4. Risks & mitigations**
- **Risk:** Visual polish might distract from content.  
  **Mitigation:** Kept color accents subtle, prioritized typography and spacing.
- **Risk:** Overfitting to one audience.  
  **Mitigation:** Kept language professional-general; industry specifics live inside project cards.

**E5. Evidence of authorship**
- All data points (dates, roles, responsibilities) map to my CV and personal records.
- Prompts and selected outputs are archived in this Appendix (Sections B–C).
- Local build logs and commit history show progressive edits (see Git history timeline).
