## D) AI Use & Integrity Statement + Revision Log

**Integrity Statement.** I used ChatGPT to brainstorm site structure, generate first-draft text (Home intro, Resume bullet tightening, Projects templates), and polish language. I verified all facts (dates, titles, employers, locations, tools) against my records, avoided confidential details, and removed any unverified claims. This appendix includes prompts and drafts (verbatim) and my edits (Kept / Edited / Removed). Final published content is in my own words.

**Revision Log (key changes):**

| Area | Kept | Edited | Removed | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Home | People-centric, C&B focus | Tone; UCW/Vancouver mention; CTAs | Generic phrases | Fit to profile; clarity |
| Resume | Action→result bullets | Dates/titles/tools; verbs | Unverifiable outcomes | Accuracy & evidence |
| Projects | Overview/Role/Outcome | Context; plain language | Jargon/overstatement | Comparable, scannable |
| Skills | Skill list | Order; badge styling | Duplicates | Recruiter-friendly scan |
| Contact | Items & labels | A11y attributes; links | — | Usability & accessibility |
| Reflection | Workflow insights | Integrity steps; specifics | Redundancy | Transparency & rigor |
