### Reflection on Building a Multi-Page MBA Portfolio with LLMs (≈400 words)

Expanding my single-page portfolio into a multi-page site required clearer structure, reusable components, and more disciplined content. Large Language Models (LLMs) helped me brainstorm a complete site map (Home, Resume, Projects/Case Studies, Skills & Certifications, Contact, plus Appendix and Reflection) and quickly draft initial copy for each page. Compared with the first assignment, using LLMs for this version worked better because I asked the model for page-by-page outlines and voice/tone constraints (concise, recruiter-friendly, action-verb bullets). This produced drafts I could then edit for accuracy and style.

What improved as I added pages was my workflow: I created short prompts for each section (e.g., “rewrite for HR Compensation & Benefits focus,” “3 bullets per project with Overview/Role/Outcome”), then iterated. The model was especially helpful at tightening language in my Resume and giving a consistent structure for Projects (Overview → Role → Outcome). It was less helpful for highly personal claims; those needed my own words and evidence.

To ensure authenticity and accuracy, I followed three rules. First, I never pasted confidential information; I summarized or anonymized as needed. Second, I verified factual content (employment dates, program names, and tools used) against my own records. Third, I clearly labeled AI involvement: this Reflection explains where an LLM contributed, and the Appendix includes prompts and drafts with my edits annotated.

For design and accessibility, I used Quarto for structure and a custom CSS theme for color and spacing. I kept headings in a logical order, avoided long paragraphs, provided descriptive link text (e.g., “Download Resume (PDF)”), and added `alt` text to my headshot for screen readers. I also tested keyboard navigation and ensured sufficient color contrast for legibility.

To maintain quality, I saved the model’s drafts in the Appendix and documented changes (Kept / Edited / Removed). I also checked for bias or over-claiming and toned down anything that sounded like marketing fluff without evidence. Finally, I exported the site to GitHub Pages and verified that internal links, file paths (e.g., `docs/`), and downloadable assets worked.

Overall, the LLM best supported me as a fast ideation and editing partner. The final content reflects my voice, validated facts, and professional focus areas—particularly HR Compensation & Benefits and my current culinary experience—presented in a structured, accessible website that I can keep extending.
